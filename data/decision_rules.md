# Decision Rules

 - Removing essential functions of an app to reduce energy consumption is not considered a valid technique.
 - Analytical models (such as scheduling algorithms) that are based on assumptions are not considered (several reasons: (1) applicability for practitioners is limited, (2) giving a simple model for the energy consumption of smartphones is inconclusive for practitioners) 
 - The detection of energy bugs (and potentially also the automatic or semi-automatic elimination of such bugs) is not a technique to improve the energy-efficiency of a mobile app
